\subsection{System Implementation}
To determine the success of the system has been designed, The system has been implemented in software application that can be used with functions defined appropriately. The following is a discussion of the implementation of a software prototype development of Smart Disaster Management System.
\subsubsection{Implementation Environment}
Implementation of this system is using software and hardware environment. The mentioning of environment is important for maintenance process in future if we need upgrade or adding some new services. The hardware specifications are :
\begin{enumerate}
